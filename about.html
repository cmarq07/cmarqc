		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p class = "section">I'm a current student with an interest in technology and 
		business fields. I've been working with computers from a young age 
		and taken on many projects, including this website, Android apps, 
		and other small-scale Java projects. I've been on a great journey in tech, 
		however, I have much more diverse hobbies 
		now and enjoy doing many things, from photography to artwork to sports! 
		I have had many great opportunities to explore the world and see all that 
		it has to offer, and I am blessed that I am studying at the 
		University of Washington!
