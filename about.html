		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p class = "section">I'm a current student at the University of Washington. 
		I love working with tech, as I've been working with computers from a young age.
		I've taken on many projects, including this website, Android apps, 
		and other small-scale Java projects. I also enjoy doing many other things, from 
		gaming to photography to artwork to sports! 
		I want to be able to travel the world a LOT more as I get older and eventually 
		establish my own business focused around a game or app. That's just a little bit about me!
