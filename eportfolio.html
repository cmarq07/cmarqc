		<!-- Overview -->
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p class = "section">In this E-Portfolio, I will be assessing where I'm currently at in regards to my education at
			the University of Washington. I will also be talking about where my future goals lie and where
			I want to see myself after graduation!

		<!-- Schooling Plan -->
		<h2 id = "schooling">Schooling Plan</h2>
		<p class = "section">I was recently admitted into my major (thank God), 
			and I will be focusing my college education opportunities around Informatics. Informatics
			is the study of how information and design intersect. It involves a lot of front-end programming
			like websites and some aspects of UI/UX, and ensuring our designs reach our intended stakeholders.
			There is also some back-end work such as in INFO 201, where I used R (a statistical programming
			language) to visualize data.
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			However, I could enhance my educational experience by getting a double major or minor. I've
			been deciding heavily whether I should get a double major in business. A double major, however,
			would be a lot of work and would most likely result in me taking a whole 2 extra years to
			graduate (since the business major has a lot of requirements). Although the double major seems
			like an attractive option, it's not feasible at this point. I looked into the Entrepreneurship
			minor and it seems interesting, but after taking one of the prerequisite classes, it felt kind
			of stressful. It would also take me an additonal year in order to graduate with the minor too.
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			These are some of the options I have in enhancing my education. I will probably continue with
			my track for the Entrepreneurship minor. I recently landed an internship with 
			Microsoft, who have a 95% return rate for their interns. Hopefully I will be able to continue
			with them throughout my college career. Another option I have after graduating is to attend
			Graduate School, however this would be very tough and I'd need to really assess if it's worth
			it.
		
		<!-- Experiential Plan -->
		<h2 id = "experiential">Experiential Plan</h2>
		<p class = "section">At the University of Washington, I want to start using my knowledge and skills
			in meaningful ways to benefit the University. A couple of options are becoming a teacher's
			assistant, doing research or doing study abroad.
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			For Winter Quarter, 2021, I have already applied to be a Teacher's Assistant for INFO 201.
			I took the class Fall Quarter, 2020 and really enjoyed how we got to visualize data and
			structure the code how we wanted it. I was very vested in the class and even did some
			"extra" things during the class just because I was enjoying it so much. I had a 97% grade at
			the end of the quarter, so hopefully I will land the job!
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			In addition, another opportunity I wanted to take advantage of while at the University of
			Washington is study abroad. The prospect of learning in another country sounds very interesting,
			and I've always wanted to travel but haven't had the resources. When the COVID-19 epidemic
			<em>hopefully</em> ends, I want to go on the Brotherhood Initiative Rome Study Abroad trip.
			Europe has always seemed like an interesting place to go for me, as I've wanted to visit
			places like France and Italy. I also eventually want to visit places in America del Sur or
			España, or just general places where I can improve my Spanish speaking skills!

		<!-- Civic & Social Values -->
		<h2 id = "civic">Civic & Social Values</h2>
		<p class = "section">I have an attitude of caring towards the world. I believe everyone should
			be treated fairly and that we should all be much more friendly to each other. However, the
			world in its current state, people are so greedy and it seems everyone is always about
			themselves. I want to be successful so I can set an example for others on how to be
			sucessful while not disregarding your morals and becoming a different person.
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			Especially in America, the motto <em>"the rich get rich and the poor get poorer"</em> couldn't
			be more true. America is all about people pushing other people down to get to the top, with
			people like Jeff Bezos being the richest in the world while simultaneously having his
			company paying NO taxes, exploiting the system. Meanwhile, there are citizens struggling
			just to make ends meet and yet still having to pay more taxes than the likes of Donald
			Trump. Our society is so backwards, where even the past president (Donald Trump), doesn't have
			to adhere to the same standards as middle/lower class citizens. In addition, I feel like
			there are so many people who are closet racists all around the country who simply don't make
			any sense to me. It's 2020, and people are still judging and discriminating on peoples' cultures
			and the color of their skin.
			<br id = "doubleBreak">
			Hopefully I can make it big one day so I can show others how to be successful, yet humble.
			It's sad to see this country, and the world, in such a depressing state and full of greed and
			hate. I want my kids to live in a world where they aren't judged so heavily and can worry
			about issues like finding new inhabitable planets, or even just working on saving
			the current planet we have now, which is a beautiful place full of great life and
			environments.
